/**
 * The one `vsce` flag that nothing else checks, DERIVED instead of remembered.
 *
 * The CHANNEL is the expensive mistake in this project. An odd minor ships
 * pre-release and an even one ships stable, the marketplace deduces neither, and
 * the only thing that says which is `--pre-release`. Forgotten on an odd minor,
 * that version goes out as the latest STABLE build to everybody and updates on
 * its own — and a version cannot be unpublished, so the only way out is
 * publishing another on top of it. Silent, in the very last step, and the one
 * mistake here with no way back.
 *
 * Dark Mode Lover declares `repository`, so `--allow-missing-repository` is deliberately
 * NOT passed: the field is there, the links `vsce` derives from it resolve, and
 * a flag that silences a question nobody is being asked is a flag that hides the
 * day the field goes away.
 *
 * What this does NOT do, because it cannot: tell whether this version has
 * already been published. That answer lives on the marketplace and `vsce
 * publish` is what refuses it. `check-release` hangs off `vscode:prepublish` and
 * covers the other half: that the version in the manifest has an entry of its
 * own in the changelog, dated and written.
