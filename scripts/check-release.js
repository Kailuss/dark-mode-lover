// Asserts that the manifest and the changelog agree about what is being cut.
//
// A package meant to be published carries a version that has never been
// published and a changelog entry that names it. The two halves fail at
// opposite ends and neither one is loud where it happens.
//
// The VERSION is refused by `vsce publish` and by nothing else. `vsce package`
// builds the same version as many times as it is asked, so a green `.vsix` says
// nothing, and the refusal lands at the very last step with the packaging and
// the whole quality gate already paid for.
//
// The CHANGELOG is refused by nobody. The marketplace renders it in its own tab,
// so a release with no entry publishes perfectly and arrives as a version whose
// page cannot say what changed. That is the half worth a check.
//
// And a changelog is the one file here that nothing compiles and nothing reads
// back: the 0.17.0 heading was written twice by two edits that were each correct
// on their own, and nothing said so.
